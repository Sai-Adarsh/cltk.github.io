The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) offers natural language processing support for Classical languages. In some areas, it extends the NLTK. The goals of the CLTK are to:

*   compile analysis-friendly corpora in a variety of Classical languages (Greek and Latin are in progress, with [more in the pipeline](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/cltk/wiki/List-of-Classical-languages));
*   gather, improve, and generate linguistic data required for NLP;
*   develop a free and open platform for generating reproducible, scientific research that advances the study of the literature and languages of the ancient world.
