The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) offers natural language processing support for Classical languages. In some areas, it extends the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/).

## Goals

*   compile analysis-friendly corpora in a variety of Classical languages (currently available for Chinese, Coptic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Pali, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Telugu, and Tibetan);
*   gather, improve, and generate linguistic data required for NLP (Greek and Latin are in progress, with [more in the pipeline](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/List-of-Classical-languages));
*   develop a free and open platform for generating reproducible, scientific research that advances the study of the languages and literatures of the ancient world.
